I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the [School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://sice.bupt.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. My research interests include **Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks**, **Resource Allocation**, **Network Virtualization**, **Satellite Communications**, and **Artificial Intelligence for Networking**.

I have published more than twenty high-level articles, including **IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials** (IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT), **IEEE Wireless Communications** (IEEE WCM), **IEEE Network**, **IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics** (IEEE TII), **IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security** (IEEE TIFS), **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems** (IEEE T-ITS), etc. 

I'm serving as a reviewer for several journals/conferences, such as IEEE TII, IEEE Network, IEEE T-ITS, IEEE TVT, IEEE TNSM, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (IEEE TMM), IEEE Internet of Things Journal (IEEE IoT-J), etc. And, I'm serving as the Technical Program Committee of the 2025 International Conference on Applied Mathematics, Modeling and Artificial Intelligence ([AMMAI 2025](https://ammai.easyaca.com.cn/)), the 2024 International Conference on Mechanical Manufacturing, Robotics and Control Engineering ([MMRCE 2024](https://mmrce.easyaca.com.cn//)). 

I have received more than ten outstanding awards and honors from the government and academia, including **National Postgraduate Scholarships**, **Second Prize of Shandong Province Postgraduate Innovation Achievement Award**, **Outstanding Graduates of Shandong Province**, etc. I have received funding from **BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation**.
