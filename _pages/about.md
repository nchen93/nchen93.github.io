title: Hi, I am Ning Chen (陈宁) 🌟
---

I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, with research interests in Satellite Communications, Artificial Intelligence for Networking, and Network Slicing. I have published over twenty high-level articles in top-tier journals. I serve as a reviewer for multiple prestigious journals, including IEEE TWC, TII, Network, TNNLS, T-ITS, TVT, TNSM, TMM, and IoT-J, and I am an editorial board member of the [Journal of Information and Computing](https://www.hkstmpress.com/journals/JIC/) as well as a Guest Editor of Electronics Special Issue: [Application of Artificial Intelligence in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/FW7A5WF45P). I have received numerous awards and honors from government and academic institutions, such as the National Postgraduate Scholarship, Second Prize of Shandong Province Postgraduate Innovation Achievement Award, and Outstanding Graduate Awards. My research has been supported by the BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation.
